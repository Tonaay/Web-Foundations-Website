            <h3>Topic</h3>
            <p>For the unit [WebF1 / U21260], I had to produce a literature review on the topic <em>"Mitigating personal information exposure on the web."</em> This literature review is about different methods of common social engineering attacks which occur
                and different approaches of mitgating the exposure of personal information.

                <h2>Analysing the mitigation of personal information exposure from social engineering attacks</h2>

                    <h3><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

                    <p>Information security (IS) is defined as protecting information and information systems from unauthorised access (Andress, 2014). In terms of IS, the user is known to be most vulnerable even if they believe they are securely protected.
                        An attacker can use a wide range of manipulative techniques known as social engineering (SE) in order to bypass security systems (Heartfield & Loukas, 2015, p. 37). This requires the exploitation of flaws in human logic with the
                        intentions of deceiving the user to gain personal information (PI) (Conteh & Schmick, 2016, p. 32). To find out if there are suitable preventative measures and resolutions to these problems, the causes of attacks need to be clearly
                        identified.

                        <h3><a id="S_E_T">Social Engineering Techniques</a></h3>

                        <p>The rise of social media websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, have made PI from the majority of society more publically accessible. This can be used to find out more about specific staff members working in a company
                            along with their contact details, potentially resulting in the information being used against the individual or company (Savage, 2011, p. 9). Another technique used in SE is Phishing; scams received from emails posing as a
                            trustworthy entity in order to obtain PI or infect a user with malware. Phishing attacks are increasingly becoming more persuasive and sophisticated while also spreading to other mediums like Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP),
                            Short Message Service (SMS), instant messaging and social media sites (Hong, 2012). </p>
                        <p>A research study on measuring SE behaviours has shown that a small number of employees are at risk from phishing as they are not aware of security indicators through web browsing and more than half of users failed to spot illegitimate
                            emails (Rocha Flores, 2016). Results from another research revealed that users are less likely to spot a phishing message, and a higher percentage of people will open a malicious message or give up PI during a phishing scam
                            (Kerner, 2016).</p>
                        <p>Conteh and Schmick (2016) also acknowledged various techniques related to Phishing. Other similar attacks include Baiting where victims are lured into receiving promised goods if they grant the attacker sensitive log-in credentials
                            such as passwords or pins to specific websites. Quid pro quo, identical to phishing, is usually targeted towards users who are experiencing technical issues, often under the guise of a trusted professional such as an information
                            technology (IT) representative. The attacker will then persuade the user to exchange their personal details in order to resolve the technical issues.</p>
                        <p>PI is not just obtained through the web but also through physical approaches. One commonly used security breaches is Tailgating where the attacker can bypass security through another user who has authorisation access (Morton, 2011).
                            Another technique is Shoulder Surfing; the attacker is able to spy on a user using graphical authentication to gather a combination of numbers, symbols or characters to gain authorisation (Gokhale & Waghmare, 2016, p. 491).</p>

                        <h3><a id="I_O_A">Impacts of Attacks</a></h3>
                        <p>The social engineering techniques discussed above are some of the causes of cyber-crimes and data breaches; which is the involvement of unauthorised access to sensitive, protected or confidential data (Sen & Borle, 2015). Cyber-crimes
                            are usually defined as having the aim to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (Bendovschi, 2015). Stanciu & Trinca (2016) cites Cisco (2014) as stating that the main focus of an attack is the exploitation
                            of user’s trust.</p>
                        <p>Data breaches can cause mass amounts of information stolen which could contain personal identifiable and credit information, as well as intellectual property (Brown H. S., 2016). Hemphill & Longstreet (2016) has identified the
                            importance of data breaches. To a company or organisation, a data breach could lead to financial loss due to abundant data being stolen.
                            <p>One case of data breach occurred on December 18, 2013 where a large discount retailer, Target, were investigating security breaches and discovered that an estimated forty million customers’ credit and debit card information
                                had been stolen by attackers (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2014, p. 61). This was confirmed on December 19, and by January 10, 2014, even more PI including, addresses, phone numbers and also email addresses of up to seventy million
                                customers were stolen during the breach which Target failed to prevent many times on several occasions (Weiss & Miller, 2015).</p>
                            <p>From an analysis that Dane (2016) conducted, stock-prices and number of records lost, all differ from a variety of data breaches however, they did not correlate with each other. This shows that impact of a data breach is unpredictable
                                in terms of data loss.</p>

                            <h3><a id="M_T_R">Mitigating the Risks</a></h3>

                            <p>Alexander (2016), has noticed a trend in SE where the number of attacks have increased dramatically and suggest that security awareness training is not being kept up to date and in pace with the attacks which are growing and
                                becoming more advanced. Cybersecurity does not recognise how severe the threat is, only until it is left to cause a significant amount of damage to the organisation.</p>
                            <p>Some ways of mitigating SE attacks is explained by Johnson (2015). The breach detection systems are designed to assist an organisation by helping them respond quicker to incidents and malware. Data classification is to identify
                                what the key data is in an organisation as well as any risks to the data and systems. This is to make sure the organisation knows what to expect when a data breach occurs.
                            </p>
                            <p>Possible solutions from Brown (2015, p. 6) are to ensure that an IT-infrastructure provides security, functionality and ease of use, however, finding the balance is key. For example, balancing out the levels of security within
                                the users’ needs such as not storing personal information on a home desktop as it would be more prone to attacks compared to a large corporate system. A guide from Chubb Group of Insurance Companies (2014) also follows
                                the same concept of mitigation where the best defence is through awareness and training. Some important factors include recognising SE psychological methods: power, authority, enticement, speed and pressure.</p>

                            <h3><a id="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
                            <p>The rise in social media sites and technology becoming more advanced, as explained by Savage (2011, p. 9), correlates to the increased number of SE attacks over the years. The current state of IS, whether personal or business,
                                has been an increasing concern highlighted on countless occasions in the literature reviewed. It has been the source of headline news in recent news and poses a vulnerability to everyone who has a digital footprint. A lack
                                of awareness is a major factor in the successes of these attacks. Mitigation and prevention of such data breaches, therefore, should include the knowledge and understanding of the different SE techniques.</p>
